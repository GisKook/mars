Project is to implement a software for the next generation of bank ATM machines. The following functionalities should be implemented:

Creating account: (first and last names, pin, DL, SSN, and email address)
Authentication of a valid user (first name and pin)
Deposit (resolve problem of the bolt in the machine is full)
Withdraw (resolve problem of the bolt in the machine not having enough money)
Verification of action
Balance
Show last n transactions
Buy stamps
Terminate the transaction

We have created a application layer standard that will allow any client to connect to the server. 
I have provided headers or structures(.h file) in another attachment, using those functionalities you need to devolop this project.
